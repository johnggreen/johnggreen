- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnggreen and a Software Engineer based in the UK. For my day-to-day development activties, 
 I work on architecting and developing scalable .net applications running in both the Cloud and On premise environments. Ths includes but is not limited to
  - .net, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Cloud Infrastructure (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) 
  - Azure DevOps CI/CD
- 👀 I’m interested in the Distributed Microservice Architectures with scalable and resilient applcations, Internet of Things, and AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ZigBee stack for improving existing intergrations. Initially my interest was to make my home 'smart' and proactively secure, 
but thanks to certain Patterns has also lead to Gas and Electricty reduction in the Home. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make life easier for others, focus on Energy consumption reduction or generally something where my skill sets can be applied.
- 📫 Send me a message, life is busy with a family to run but I'm always keen on hearing from the community and contributing whenever I can.
